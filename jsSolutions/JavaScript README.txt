1 - JavaScript Screensaver

With the jQuery plugin, Javascript is not friendly when it comes to manipulating images, let alone animating them. This is a simple recursive solution to animating in JavaScript without
jQuery.

Included:
a - The source file

2 - Javascript image gallery

This was coded by me using the jQuery and Handlebars 
Templating Libraries. (View Source for more details)

The artwork is also my work, do not copy.

Simply open the index.html file to view and click on any image to
expand. (Chrome recommended)
